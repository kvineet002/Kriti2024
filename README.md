# Anti-Spam Protection Readme

## Project Submission Interval

To prevent spam and maintain a high standard of contributions, users are allowed to add projects at a maximum interval of 10 minutes. This means you can submit a new project, but you'll need to wait for at least 10 minutes before submitting another.

## Why the Limit?

This interval helps us filter out repetitive or low-quality submissions, ensuring that each project gets the attention it deserves. It also enhances the overall experience for everyone in the community.
